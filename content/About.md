The ResinStack is a platform designed to run the Hashicorp stack in
the context of immutable infrastructure.

The Hashicorp stack consists of Nomad, Consul, and Vault.  Nomad
schedules containers, Consul provides service discovery and some
request routing features, and Vault provides secret management.

This project is not affiliated with Hashicorp, it is merely a
community maintained distribution of Open Source software.
