The ResinStack has an interesting way of both highlighting problems
and then proving out interesting solutions to those problems.  Take
for example the first secret problem wherein a machine must have some
form of identity to be able to resolve its secure configuration values
stored in Vault.  There are many ways to solve this problem, but one
such solution was presented by ResinStack developer Michael Aldridge
at HashiConf Global '22 in LA.  This post will be updated when the
recording of the talk is released, but until then, here are the slides
from the talk: [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vQy7ePtH1afvWnI9iP5YH5oaWR47HjFqJHEiaLxOgvkd3rVKxJm5mlExe0lzEvCC1S1FRa3CA2BIPKX/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000).
